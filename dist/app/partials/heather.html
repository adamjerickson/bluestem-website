        <p>I am the mother of two teenagers, daughter Syble, a senior at North Platte High school and son Montana, a sophomore currently completing his high school education through the University of Nebraska Online HIgh School.  We currently reside in North Platte, NE.  We are looking forward to moving to Lincoln at some point during the summer of 2017.  We have spent a great deal of time in the Lincoln area over the past 18 years and are excited not only to enjoy the positive vibrancy, growth, and opportunity of the area but also, to be closer to family.</p>

        <p>I grew up attending North Platte Public Schools and have been interested in alternative learning approaches since my days as a young student. My first experience with the Montessori method was merely that of watching my younger sister attend and thrive in an Elementary Early Childhood Montessori Center for several years.  Feeling as though my own early learning lacked empathy and engagement, my interest in a variety of educational models peaked early on and has only grown since.  I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology with minors in social and economic geography from Western State College in Gunnison, CO.  In addition, I am a certified Prenatal, Labor, and Postpartum Doula (not currently practicing though due to time constraints) and am a USA Swimming Certified Coach/owner of a club swim team in North Platte serving youth ages 5 - 19.  I am also a private swim lesson instructor and work with the “Little Otters” infant and toddler learn-to-swim program.</p>

        <p>Prior to my application to and acceptance of the Lead Teacher position with Bluestem, I was working on a Teacher  Certification Endorsement in Special Education through the University of Kearney’s Transitional Teacher Certification Program.  Currently, I am enrolled full-time in the Elementary Montessori Education certification program through the Mid- America Montessori Training Center in Omaha, NE.  I will be completing coursework and engaging in on-site training between now and the end of July in preparation for certification.  Ultimately, I intend to add the Infant and Early Childhood certifications as well and will also work to complete the Special Education endorsement I have started as I am too close now not to!</p>

        <p>My passion has been the Montessori Method for the balance of my own children’s lives with a great deal of personal interest and self-teaching in the Method prior to becoming a mother.  I had the blessing of teaching my children in the home from birth to age 14 for my daughter and birth to age 12 for my son.  While we utilized a combination of methods and materials, we generally found ourselves most attracted to Montessori.  During this time, I had the pleasure of taking part in a home educators learning co-op which gave me even richer experience working with different learning styles and methods.  Concurrently, I was working in the youth education program at my church where we utilized a program created in partnership with Maria Montessori, known as “Catechesis of the Good Shepherd.”  Not only were the methods and materials designed by Maria Montessori, but it was here that I was able to participate in my first official training sessions using the Montessori method.</p>

        <p>Presently, I am employed as a para-professional with North Platte Public Schools working in 6th grade classrooms.  In my free time, I love being outdoors doing most anything active including gardening, walking, running, bicycling, kayaking and camping.  I also enjoy cooking, dancing, yoga, music and travel.  I believe myself to be a compassionate and observant person with an open mind, yearning for discovery, and passion for children.  I am thrilled to have an opportunity to assist children in their learning journey as well as create and spread a sense of excitement for creating empathetic and engaged learners who can strive for independence while also reaching out to peers and the greater community to advance learning and make the world we live in that much brighter.</p>
