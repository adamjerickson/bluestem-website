    <p>We plan to open our doors in the fall of 2017, but we can't do it alone.  We are raising money to cover start-up costs for the school, and we need your help.</p>

    <h2>Swag</h2>
    <a id="store"></a>
    <p>We have a store at CafePress.  If you'd like to buy a t-shirt or coffee mug to show your love of Bluestem, please do so.</p>
