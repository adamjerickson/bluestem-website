    <h1>A different kind of school</h1>

    <p>Bluestem's mission is to foster creativity, 
    independence, and ingenuity by providing a 
    child-centric learning environment, hands-on 
    activities, and integration with the community.</p>

    <p>Our central location will allow children
    to learn about and experience their city.  Our
    committment to the environment and nature will teach 
    children to love and protect their world.</p>

    <p>Opening for the 2017-18 school year, Bluestem 
    will be centrally located, and with the help of 
    the Lincoln community, will offer generous 
    scholarships to make this wonderful 
    educational opportunity available to all.</p>
