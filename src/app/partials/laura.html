    <p class="lauraMore" style="display: none">Her own Montessori education developed a life-long love of learning that has led her to a BA from Hastings College, a MA in Medieval History from the University of Washington, and most of the way through a PhD (oh that pesky dissertation!).  In 2008 she became a Fulbright Scholar, and took her husband and baby daughter to study medieval manuscripts in Germany.  She has taught hundreds of college students as a teaching assistant and then as an instructor, and was recognized by her department for her excellence in teaching.  Laura is a Girl Scout leader, an active volunteer in her daughtersâ€™ schools, and a mother of two spirited girls.  </p>
