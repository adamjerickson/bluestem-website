# Reset

The inuitcss `reset` module is a considered approach to resetting elements. It
selectively removes margins and paddings from certain elements, and provides
some sensible defaults for some others.


# Shared

The inuitcss `shared` module contains several high-level rulesets which apply a
consistent, shared declaration (typically `margin`s) across a number of
elements.
